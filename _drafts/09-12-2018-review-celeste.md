I'm almost finished playing through Celeste, a platformer a la Super Meat Boy,
where the point of the whole thing is that you're going to die a lot, but you're
going to enjoy doing it — because *boy* does it feel good to execute a
jump and a glide well enough to clear a screen.

In hard games, where stages are predictable (and therefore, repeatable — Dark
Souls comes to mind), your only enemy is yourself. It doesn't take a genius to
find parallels between the medium (the gameplay) and the message, here. You're
playing Celeste, so you're also playing to overcome your shortcomings and
mistimed button presses. And you're also following the story *of* Celeste
(our titular main character), who is climbing a mountain (Celeste Mountain, by
the way) to overcome *her* shortcomings.

Celeste (the character) wants to climb Celeste (the mountain). 

It doesn't take a genius to figure out Celeste. It's unquestionably about the
titular main character's struggle to overcome her depression and accept her
shortcomings.

The game's main antagonist,
setting, and even its genre have obvious analogs in Celeste's (our titular main
character) struggle with depression. I like that about it.

It helps that the game isn't cagey about the fact that Celeste has depression.
(event caused by anxiety attack happens in the beginning of the game). Even
Celeste isn't in denial about her mental illness. She talks about her depression
in a very straightfoward way. She knows its there — which is why she's trying to
run away from it as fast as she possibly can.

(celeste is very mechanics driven so it makes sense that the plot isn't written
to win any literary awards. But it's not a plot that's just there because there
needs to be a plot. it feels very intentional.)
